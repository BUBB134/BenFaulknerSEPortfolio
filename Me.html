								<h2>Why computer science?</h2>
								<p>I have been enfatuated by computer science since the age of around 8, this is when I recieved a book about learning to program in python. Although back then the laptop I was using could barely run the simplest of program I was immediately captivated.
								A few years after this I convinced my mum to 'loan' me the money to be able to build my first PC. Alongside my grandad we managed to assemble the parts without any major setbacks. This finally gave me the opportunity to be able to further my interest in this field.
								Once that PC had quickly fallen behind the current technologies my grandad and I built a second PC of parts with much higher performance. This is the PC I am using to create this website.</p>
								<p>On the academic side of things computer science had always been a strong suit of mine from primary school all the way to A levels. In year 3 I was always in the computer lab for open days and I always got stellar reports from my computing teacher at parents evening.
								Once it was time to choose GCSE subjects it was a no brainer, I didn't really care what else I chose as long as I could do computer science. When I had to move schools I told my mum the only subject I cared about tring out was computer science nothing else mattered to me at the time.</p>
								<p>After achieving the highest possible grade for GCSE computer science it would have only made sense for me to go on and do A-level computer science. I also chose maths as I knew that this was as important if not even more important to be able to go on and do computer science at university.
								It was lucky then that these were my two favourite subjects throughout all of school and my ability in them helped me to settle in after moving schools. I want on to achieve an A in both of these subjects at both AS and A level and moving on to computer science at the university of York.</p>
