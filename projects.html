								<h2>Projects</h2>
								<p>My most impressive project involves using computer vision and machine learning to be able to take video input of sign language in real time
								and then being able to translate this to written english to help those who may need it to be able to communicate with others.</p>
								<p>Another of my machine learning projects involves using a model to be able to predict the future movement of stocks based on past data. This ties in with my
								interest in financial markets and day trading. I hope to use this model in future to execute trades profitably. I will update in due time with results.</p>
								<h2>Experience</h2>
								<h3>Maths Tutor</h3>
								<p>During my time in sixth form I was a maths tutor for year 7 pupils within my school. In this role I learnt many skills, the main one being communication.
								being able to communicate with others who do not have the level of understanding that you have is an important skill that I definitely improved during my time in this role.</p>
								<h3>Psychology Tutor</h3>
								<p>Again in sixth form I had a pupil in year 11 who I gave 1-1 psychology tutoring. I recieved feedback from my psychology teacher that my pupil was making great progress in the areas
								that we had worked on. I found it important to be able to build raport between me and my pupil as it helped us to make headway during the short sessions that we had and be able to maintain full focus during this time.</p>
